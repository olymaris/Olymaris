## What we do

Olymaris is a full-stack product studio focused on **results**, not buzzwords.  
We design, build, and refactor digital products that are:

- **Fast** – performance-first web and mobile apps
- **Modern** – clean UI, minimal friction, delightful UX
- **Search-ready** – technical SEO baked into the codebase
- **AI-aware** – products that leverage AI for real insights, not hype

### Core services

- **Web Development** – modern, maintainable frontends + solid backends  
- **Mobile Development** – cross-platform apps aligned with your product strategy  
- **UI/UX Design** – flows that reduce friction and increase conversion  
- **AI Insight Integration** – plug useful AI into the product, not just into a slide deck  
- **Modern Web Revamp** – turning legacy or outdated products into clean, high-performing experiences  
- **Search Visibility Upgrade** – technical and structural improvements so your product can actually be found

## How we work

We prefer **clarity over noise**:

1. **Discover the leverage points**  
   We identify where small product changes create the biggest impact (speed, UX, visibility, or code quality).

2. **Design with intent**  
   UX and UI decisions are tied to measurable goals: activation, retention, or revenue.

3. **Build with discipline**  
   Clean, testable, scalable code. No “magic” stacks, just the right tools for the job.

4. **Ship, measure, refine**  
   Release quickly, observe behavior, and iterate where it truly moves the needle.

## Tech & tools

We are flexible on stack, but opinionated on quality.

- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, modern SPA/SSR setups  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python-based services, REST/GraphQL APIs  
- **Mobile**: React Native / cross-platform solutions  
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL, modern cloud databases  
- **AI & Insights**: integration with LLMs, analytics, tracking, and behavior data  
- **Infra**: cloud-native deployments, CI/CD, production monitoring

## For collaborators & clients

If you are:

- Maintaining a **legacy product** that needs a serious upgrade  
- Struggling with **slow, clunky UX** that kills conversion  
- Wanting to **add AI and analytics** in a meaningful, product-driven way  
- Looking for a team that thinks in **systems, incentives, and real-world tradeoffs**

Then you’re the kind of person we build with.
